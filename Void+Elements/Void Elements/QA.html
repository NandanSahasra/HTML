void elements means it is not contains the end tag .itself is contain the end tag like This
<hr/> : horizational line it will show
<br/>: break the line show the next line

Note:
do not give <br> same pagraph .where it is requried to seperate the pagraph then only use
like address
<p> address<hr/>
    name:<br/>
    age:<br/>
    H.no:<br/>

In HTML5 no need to put / 
<hr><br> and <hr/> <br/> both are same
better to use in code <hr/> and <br/>
